ok, I'm going to try and explain the dupe bug as clearly as possible.

So, you have a solid block, doesn't matter what, place a carpenter's pressure plate on top.
Then you add a block to the pressure plate (right clikc on it)
if you brake the top side of the supporting block, you mine the block itself, not the pressure plate
you have a change (50/50) of getting the inventory block of the pressure plate duped


I hope you guys can fix this
